Before we start to get our hands dirty, let's first define some basic concepts and prepare  the environment.

### Basic Concepts

- **Machine Learning**: It is a collection of techniques that can be used to make sense of the data.
- **Models**: In machine learning, a model is a set of rules that represent what a system has learned from data.

### Setting Up

All the code examples and
